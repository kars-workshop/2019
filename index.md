The purpose of the **Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop** is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems, where researchers can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.

The **2nd Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop** focuses on all aspects related to the exploitation of external and **explicit knowledge** sources to feed and build a recommendation engine, and on the adoption of interactions based on the **conversational paradigm**. The aim is to go beyond the traditional accuracy goal and to start a new generation of algorithms and approaches with the help of the methodological diversity embodied in fields such as **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Information Retrieval (IR)** and **Information Systems (IS)**. Consequently the focus lies on works improving the user experience and following goals such as user engagement and satisfaction or customer value.

**KaRS 2019** is the **2nd edition of the Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop**. It will take place on **November 3rd-7th, 2019, Beijing, China** co-located with the **28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2019)**.
